about_header: The waffle formula
---
about_text: With a lot of love we craft from raw ingredients a delicious waffle dough. We use long researched recipes, which we don't want to hide from you.
---
about_text2: After years of research, we succeeded in reconstructing the formula for the waffle dough. It was long considered lost, but has now been made accessible again using quantum technology and blockchain.
---
about_text3: One of the secrets of good waffle dough is the freshness of the ingredients. Another is the quality.

A waffle consists of five hearts. That is not an error!
A heart metaphorically stands for goodness and love. A waffle does the same!

---
icons_text:

The C3WOC enjoys great popularity. Especially in the vicinity of the Chaos Computer Club and Chaos-related events.<br/>
Of course waffles should not be missing there!
---
icons_text_2:

The C3WOC doesn't just make waffles that you can buy for money. 

<b>but it's about a lot more!</b>

red_1: We are happy about new faces.
---
red_2:

Baking waffles on your own is boring and over time really exhausting. But together it makes a lot more fun.
If more people participate, the waffle will bake, plan, organize and eat a great experience.
---
red_3:

We would be very happy about more active people who enjoy waffles. Planning and doing something with just a few people is very stressful and doesn't work for an unlimited time.

Please join us!
